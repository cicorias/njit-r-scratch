1. Do hierarchical clustering of the samplesusing the numeric features, and retrieve the two largest clusters. Then for each of these two clusters, find out how many samples with loss > the median loss; and how many with loss < the median loss.
2. Do kmeans clustering of the samplesusing the numeric features, by setting k=2. Then for each of these two clusters, find out how many samples with loss > the median loss; and how many with loss < the median loss.
3. Do PCA of the datausing the numeric featuresand use the first two PCs to represent a sample and re-do Question 1 and Question 2.Also generate barplot of the variance of the first five PCs.Hint: use prcomp function in R
