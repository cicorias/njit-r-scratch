## Setup
Download the winequality-red_binary.csv file from Canvas

## Classification
### Question 1 
- Use the first half of the training data (rows) to train a Logistic Regression model to make prediction for the independent variable “quality_bin”, and then
- Test on the second half of the training data

> Q: What is the classification error you obtain? 

> Q: What is the AUC of the testing? 

- Make a ROC curve of it.

### Question 2
- Conduct 5-fold cross-validation using the entire training data to estimate the classification error
> Q: Is it larger or smaller than the classification error you obtain in (1)? 

> Q: Which one will be closer to the true classification error of your classifier do you think?
